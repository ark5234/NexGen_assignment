# Innovation Brief â€” Predictive Delivery Optimizer

Company: NexGen Logistics Pvt. Ltd.

Prepared: (prototype auto-generated)

Executive summary
-----------------
NexGen faces delivery performance and cost pressures. This prototype targets predictive operations by forecasting likely delivery delays and recommending corrective actions to reduce late deliveries and operational cost leakage.

Key insights
------------
- A predictive model (RandomForest) trained on historical delivery, route and cost data identifies orders with high delay risk.
- Feature importance highlights distance, traffic delay, and priority as top predictors.
- Simple rule-based interventions (use faster vehicle, alternative carrier, re-route) can be suggested and cost impacts estimated.

Prototype deliverables
----------------------
- Streamlit app that loads data, runs EDA, trains the model, shows visualizations, and exports recommendations.
- Synthetic data generator for demo runs if real CSVs are not available.

Business impact estimate
------------------------
- Target reduction in late deliveries: initial estimate 10-20% among identified at-risk orders.
- Cost trade-off: prioritized orders may incur higher transport costs; optimization should consider order lifetime value.

Next steps
----------
1. Integrate with live TMS / carrier APIs for real-time telemetry.
2. Build an optimization module to trade off delay reduction vs incremental cost.
3. Run A/B tests on recommended actions to quantify impact and calibrate model thresholds.
