---**Advanced Predictive Intelligence for Modern Logistics**What you get:



## Overview- A Streamlit app (`app.py`) that loads the 7 CSVs in `./data/` and builds merged datasets.



NexGen Logistics AI Platform is a next-generation predictive delivery optimization system built with cutting-edge machine learning and interactive visualizations. This platform transforms logistics operations through:[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9%2B-blue)](https://www.python.org/)- If the real CSVs are missing, the app creates realistic synthetic data for demo purposes.
