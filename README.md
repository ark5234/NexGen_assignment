.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run app.py

## Troubleshooting

```3. Install dependencies:

### Problem: `No module named streamlit`



```powershell

# Solution: Use the correct venv**Option 3: Using absolute paths (if activation fails)**```bash

cd nexgen_logistics

.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1```powershell

pip install -r requirements.txt

```# Run directly with full pathspip install -r requirements.txt



### Problem: `File does not exist: app.py`c:\path\to\nexgen_logistics\.venv\Scripts\streamlit.exe run c:\path\to\nexgen_logistics\app.py



```powershell``````- **PDF Report Generation**: Professional executive reports with ReportLab

# Solution: Make sure you're in the nexgen_logistics directory

cd nexgen_logistics

streamlit run app.py

```### Important Notes



### Problem: Execution policy error on Windows



```powershell- **Directory**: Always run from the `nexgen_logistics` folder (where `app.py` is located)4. Run the application:- **CSV Exports**: Download high-risk orders and recommendations

# Solution: Run PowerShell as Administrator

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser- **Virtual Environment**: Use the `.venv` folder inside `nexgen_logistics`, NOT the parent folder

```

- **URL**: The app will launch at `http://localhost:8501````bash

###  Problem: Plotly deprecation warnings

- **Data**: CSV files in `data/` folder are auto-generated if missing

The warnings about "keyword arguments deprecated" are from Plotly itself and don't affect functionality. They can be safely ignored - the application works perfectly.
